Hi! Iâ€™m Sameeha!

I enjoy making inventive and unique software applications for a multitude of varying purposes, 
but ultimately, programs that will ultimately help someone, somewhere. Extremely interested in design architecture, but completely 
committed to its' execution, backend to front. 

About Me: 
- Currently studying Computer Science at Austin College (minoring in Gender Studies and Latin).
- Looking forward to gaining experience as a full-time member of a software engineering team.
