Hi! I’m Sameeha!

I enjoy creating applications that have niche uses, and that drive a passion. Professionally, I work in fintech and write applications for Paycom - due to a lot of overtime and high-priority projects there, I haven't been able to do side projects yet, but I'm hoping somewhere with better work-life balance can allow me to put my ideas to life. I have projects on here from school, that were mainly written in Java, but I also have 3+ years of experience in Javascript/TypeScript, React JS, PHP, and ASP .NET and C#. I work on projects that manage billions of dollars and generate lots of client impact, scaling from backend financial services, to client-facing applications. 

About Me: 
- Looking for remote jobs specifically, preferably in fintech!
